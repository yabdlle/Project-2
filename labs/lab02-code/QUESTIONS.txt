Lab Instructions
================

  Follow the instructions below to complete this lab assignment.
  - For sections marked CODE, complete the code indicated. Use the
    command 'make test-code' to check if your code is complete.
  - For sections marked QUIZ, fill in an (X) for the appropriate
    response in this file. Use the command 'make test-quiz' to see if
    all of your answers are correct.
  - DO NOT CHANGE any parts of this file except the QUIZ sections as it
    may interfere with the tests otherwise.
  - If your 'QUESTIONS.txt' file seems corrupted, restore it by copying
    over the 'QUESTIONS.txt.bak' backup file.
  - When you complete the exercises, check your answers with 'make test'
    and if all is well, create a zip file with 'make zip' and upload it
    to Gradescope. Ensure that the autograder results there reflect your
    local results.
  - IF YOU WORK IN A GROUP only one member needs to submit and then add
    the names of their group.

Reading and Writing Files
=========================

CODE Copy a File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open and study the file 'copy_file.c'. The 'main' function in this file is
provided for you. This program accepts two command-line arguments: the name of a
source file and the name of the destination file. The purpose of this program is
to produce a copy of the source file in the destination file, overwriting the
destination file if it already exists.

Complete the function 'copy_file' in this C file. Your code should work for
either text files or binary files.

Seeking Within Binary Files
===========================

CODE Read Last n ints in a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open and study the file 'read_last_ints.c'. The 'main' function in this file is
provided for you. This program accepts two command-line arguments: a name for a
file 'f' and a number 'n'. The purpose of the program is to read and print the
last 'n' ints from the binary file 'f', in the order they appear in the file.
Each number should be printed on one line of output.

Complete the function 'read_last_ints' in this C file. As a hint: look at using
the 'fseek' function to start reading forward at the right location in the
binary file. Your code should work for a file of any size, but you may assume
the file contains at least as many int values as the user asks to read.

Like any function involving file I/O, 'read_last_ints' could encounter an error.
It should return 0 upon success or -1 if an error occurred.

QUIZ File I/O
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Complete the two code exercises above before answering these quiz questions.

  Which I/O functions did you need to use to implement the 'copy_file' function?
  - ( ) 'fread' and 'fwrite' if the source file is a binary file, 'fscanf' and
        'fprintf' if the source file is a text file.
  - ( ) 'fscanf' and 'fprintf' are the best to use regardless of the type of the
        source file.
  - ( ) 'fread' and 'fwrite' are the best to use regardless of the type of the
        source file.
  - ( ) None of the above

  Which of the following best describes the 'perror' function?
  - ( ) It prints out the value of 'errno' set by the most recent operation.
  - ( ) It prints out a string describing the meaning of 'errno' as set by the
        most recent operation.
  - ( ) It prints out the string passed in as an argument followed by the value
        of 'errno'
  - ( ) It prints out the string passed in as an argument followed by a string
        describing the meaning of 'errno' as set by the most recent operation.

  Which of the following is best to pass as the third argument to 'fseek' in the
  'read_last_ints' function?
  - ( ) 'SEEK_CUR', to compute an offset from the current position
  - ( ) 'SEEK_SET', to compute an offset from the start of the file
  - ( ) 'SEEK_END', to compute an offset from the end of the file
  - ( ) None of the above
